#理解 梅尔倒谱系数 (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient)

> The main point to understand about speech is that the sounds generated by a human are filtered by the shape of the vocal tract including tongue, teeth etc.

> The shape of the vocal tract manifests itself in the envelope of the short time power spectrum, and the job of MFCCs is to accurately represent this envelope.

How ubiquitous this idea is
measure the air pressure? 这个说法很有意思。声波的觉传播形式就是改变空气的局部气压。

麦克风只是拾取了一个各种声音的最终叠加值。

The key idea is gonna be to take this graph, and sort of wrap it up around a circle.

Concretely, here's what I mean by that. Imaging a rotating vector where each point in time, it's length is equal to the height of our graph for that time. So high points of the graph correspond to a greater distance from the origin.
