- a collection of numbers
take a collection of numbers to find a pair of numbers

another set of numbers, could be

So, in this case, I guess, you're looking for a pair of numbers that add up to eight  

So, in this case, there isn't a pair of numbers add up to eight

that is true.

How is those numbers, could I assume all those numbers are integer?

negatives or positives?

That's could happens

OK, Cool.


First, the first simple solution, of course, Just comparing every possible pair.

So I could have to do two for loops.

One scaning the whole thing,
Second one, let's say

Since it's a sorted array, I could use binary search.

If I go here, then I binary search the other one.

OK, let me try to bound this things

Move this one over here.

linear solution.

move lower higher.

not elegant but workable.

my high 
my low

while my my low is less than my high


check, the numbers before this one.

1. clarification 
2. think a loud
3. talk before you write
4. test solution
