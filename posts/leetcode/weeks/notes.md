## 1259. Handshakes That Don't Cross
You are given an even number of people num_people that stand around a circle and each person shakes hands with someone else, so that there are num_people / 2 handshakes total.

Return the number of ways these handshakes could occur such that none of the handshakes cross.

Since this number could be very big, return the answer mod 10^9 + 7



Example 1:

Input: num_people = 2
Output: 1

Example 2:

![1259_2](./img/1259_2.png)

Input: num_people = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to do it, the first way is [(1,2),(3,4)] and the second one is [(2,3),(4,1)].
Example 3:

![1259_3](./img/1259_3.png)


Input: num_people = 6
Output: 5
Example 4:

Input: num_people = 8
Output: 14


Constraints:

2 <= num_people <= 1000
num_people % 2 == 0
