```
The diﬃculties faced by systems relying on hard-coded knowledge suggestthat AI systems need the ability to acquire their own knowledge, by extracting patterns from raw data. This capability is known asmachine learning.

从原始数据中抽取模式，获取新知识的研究，被称作机器学习（Machine Learning)。

This solution isto allow computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms ofa hierarchy of concepts, with each concept deﬁned through its relation to simplerconcepts. By gathering knowledge from experience, this approach avoids the needfor human operators to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs.
The hierarchy of concepts enables the computer to learn complicated concepts bybuilding them out of simpler ones. 
If we draw a graph showing how these concepts built on top of each other, the graph is deep, with many layers. For this reason,we call this approach to AI deep learning.

深度学习：通过经验数据，学习出一系列层次概念。每个概念又通过这个概念与一些简单的概念之间的关系进行定义。通过对经验数据的学习，避免了人工定义计算机所需的所有知识。这种架构使计算机可以在简单概念的基础上学习出复杂的概念。如果我们要用图来表示这些概念之间的关系，我们将得到一个非常深的、具有很多层的图。因此，我们称这种方法为深度学习（deep learning）。
