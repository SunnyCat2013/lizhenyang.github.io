> To begin, there are two very important things that you should understand if you’re considering a career as a Machine Learning engineer. 
First, it’s not a “pure” academic role. 
You don’t necessarily have to have a research or academic background. 
Second, it’s not enough to have either software engineering or data science experience. You ideally need both.
